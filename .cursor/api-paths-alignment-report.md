# API Paths Alignment Report

This report compares API endpoint usage in `frontend3` (user-provided list) with backend-defined endpoints from `SupabaseEndpointMap` (the single source of truth).

**Matching logic:**
- Only endpoints in SupabaseEndpointMap are considered implemented in the backend.
- If a frontend endpoint matches a backend endpoint except for a `/supabase` prefix, it is marked as mismatched but the prefix difference is noted.
- All other non-matching endpoints are listed as missing.

## ⚠️ Mismatched (Prefix Difference Only)

| Method | Frontend Path                        | Backend Path                        | Note                        |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| GET    | /user/progress                       | /supabase/users/:userId/progress    | Prefix difference           |

## ❌ Missing in Backend

| Method | Path                                 |
|--------|--------------------------------------|

**Legend:**
- `:param` indicates a dynamic path segment.
- "Prefix difference" means the only difference is a `/supabase` prefix in the backend.
- "Missing in Backend" means the endpoint is not implemented in SupabaseEndpointMap.
