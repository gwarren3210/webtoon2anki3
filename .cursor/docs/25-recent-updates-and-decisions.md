# Recent Updates and Decisions

## Overview
This document summarizes the key updates and decisions made in the Webtoon2Anki project, focusing on the integration of OCR, translation, and Anki package generation services.

## 1. OCR Service Updates

### Tiling Implementation
- Implemented adaptive tiling in `smartOcrProcessor.ts`
- Modified tile height calculation to use `imgHeight / baseDivisions`
- Simplified deduplication logic using Map-based approach
- Removed complex merging logic in favor of post-processing

### Text Processing
- Added Korean NLP integration planning
- Proposed both Python (Mecab) and JavaScript solutions
- Focus on handling compound words, particles, and verb conjugations
- Target of 20-50 most important words per chapter

## 2. Translation Service
### Translation and Ranking
- Implemented Gemini for both translation and word ranking
- Integrated with Google Cloud Vertex AI
- Handles both translation and importance scoring in one API call
- Reduces API costs and latency by combining operations

### Architecture [depricated]
- Implemented Papago translation engine
- Created `ITranslationEngine` interface for abstraction
- Added support for Korean-English translation
- Implemented context-aware translation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface TranslatedWordInfo {
  original: string;
  translated: string;
  context: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
}
```

## 3. Anki Package Generation

### Microservice Architecture
- Implemented Python Flask service with `genanki`
- Deployed to Google Cloud Run
- Endpoint: `/build-package`
- Supports custom card templates and configurations

### Configuration Options
```json
{
  "front_fields": ["Korean"],
  "back_fields": ["English"],
  "create_duplicate": false
}
```

## 4. API Integration

### Endpoints
1. OCR: `/ocr` (multipart/form-data)
2. Text Grouping: `/group-text` (application/json)
3. Translation: `/translate` (application/json)
4. Anki Package: `/create-anki-package` (application/json)

### Error Handling
- Standardized error responses
- Detailed logging throughout pipeline
- Proper cleanup of temporary files

## 5. Deployment Decisions

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Google Cloud Run for microservices
- Docker containerization
- Cloud Build for CI/CD
- Environment variable management

### Security
