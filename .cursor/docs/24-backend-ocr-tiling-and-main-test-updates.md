# Recent Code Updates for Webtoon to Anki API

This document summarizes the significant code changes and additions made to the `backend` services since the last comprehensive documentation in `22-webtoon-to-anki-api.md`.

## `backend/services/ocr-api/smartOcrProcessor.ts`

### `filterOcrResults` Method

*   **Simplification**: The logic for filtering OCR results has been significantly simplified.
*   **Deduplication Strategy**: Now uses a `Map` to deduplicate OCR results. The key for the map is a string combining the rounded center X and Y coordinates of the bounding box (``${centerX},${centerY}``).
*   **Preference Logic**: When duplicate positions are detected, the result whose bounding box is *further away* from its originating tile's **Y-edges** (top or bottom) is preferred. This aims to keep the most "central" and likely complete word from overlapping tiles.
*   **Removed Merging Logic**: The complex `areBoundingBoxesOverlapping` and `calculateDistanceFromTileEdge` methods, along with any text merging logic (e.g., keeping longer text, merging identical text), have been removed. The assumption is that text merging and more advanced deduplication are handled in subsequent processing steps.

### `createAdaptiveTiles` Method

*   **Final Tile Height Calculation**: The logic for `finalTileHeight` was modified by the user from `Math.min(tileHeight, maxTileHeight)` to `imgHeight / baseDivisions`. This change directly impacts the number of tiles generated and how image height is distributed among them.
*   **Debugging Logs**: Extensive `console.log` statements were added throughout this method to help diagnose tiling behavior, including:
    *   Image dimensions, file size, and threshold.
    *   Key calculation variables (`excessRatio`, `baseDivisions`, `overlapFactor`, `adjustedDivisions`, `tileHeight`, `finalTileHeight`).
    *   Loop progression details (`startY`, `endY`, `actualTileHeight`, `overlapHeight`).
    *   Total number of tiles created.

## `backend/services/ocr-api/test/ocrApi.test.ts`

*   **Removed Outdated Tests**: Test cases for `calculateDistanceFromTileEdge` and the previous `filterOcrResults` logic were removed as these methods/logic no longer exist or were simplified.
*   **`createAdaptiveTiles` Test Update**:
    *   The test now uses `large-sample.jpg` (1.8MB) to specifically test the adaptive tiling behavior.
    *   Assertions were updated to expect exactly **two** tiles for this image and to verify proper overlap between them.
    *   A new assertion was added to confirm that the `toBuffer()` size of each generated tile is less than the `fileSizeThreshold` configured in the `SmartOCRProcessor`.
*   **New `describe.only` Block for Large Image OCR Test**:
    *   A new `describe.only('SmartOCRProcessor Large Image OCR Test', ...)` block was created to isolate and specifically test the end-to-end OCR process for the `large-sample.jpg` image.
    *   This test processes the large image and saves the OCR results to `../test-data/largeImageOcrOutput.json`.
    *   A `beforeEach` block was included to initialize the `SmartOCRProcessor` for this new test suite.
*   **`fs` Import Fixes**: The `fs` import was consistently updated to `import { promises as fs } from 'fs';` across the file, and `await` was added to all `fs.readFile` calls to correctly handle asynchronous file operations with promise-based methods.

## `backend/services/testMain.ts`

*   **Refactored Test Execution**: The single `runTest` function was refactored into two distinct asynchronous functions:
    *   `runSmallImageTest()`: Processes the original `sample-webtoon-image.png`.
    *   `runLargeImageTest()`: Processes the `alternate-large-image.jpg` and saves its Anki package to `webtoon_anki_large_package.apkg`.
*   **Promise-based `fs`**: All file system operations (`fs.existsSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`) were updated to their asynchronous, promise-based counterparts (`fs.stat`, `fs.mkdir`, `fs.writeFile`) using `await`.
*   **Sequential Execution**: Both tests are now executed sequentially within an immediately invoked async function at the end of the file to ensure proper flow.

## Running TypeScript Files

Due to the `"type": "module"` setting in `package.json`, TypeScript files must be run using `ts-node` with the `--esm` flag:

```bash
npx ts-node [path/to/your/file.ts] --esm
```

For `testMain.ts`, this would be:

```bash
npx ts-node backend/services/testMain.ts --esm
```
