# Context: Docker Integration for Python OCR Development

This document updates the context based on recent progress with running the Python OCR scripts within Docker and setting up an efficient development workflow.

## Current Status

1.  **Python Environment:** The Python environment with necessary dependencies (`opencv-python`, `paddleocr`) is confirmed to be working correctly within the Docker container (`ocr-python`).
2.  **Image Tiling Script (`image_tiling.py`):** The `image_tiling.py` script has been successfully executed inside the Docker container, demonstrating its functionality.
3.  **Development Workflow:** We have established a development workflow using Docker volume mounts (`-v local_path:container_path`) to allow local code changes to be reflected inside the running container without requiring frequent image rebuilds. This addresses the issue of local code modifications not appearing in the container's execution.

## Next Steps

Building upon the established Docker environment and development workflow, the immediate next steps for the Python OCR implementation, based on `.cursor/OCR-TASKS.md`, are:

1.  **Implement `paddle_ocr_engine.py`:** Complete the implementation of the OCR logic for individual tiles using the `paddleocr` library.
2.  **Implement `deduplicate_ocr_results.py`:** Develop the logic to process and deduplicate results from overlapping tiles.
3.  **Refine `ocr_pipeline.py`:** Finalize the main pipeline script to orchestrate tiling, OCR, and deduplication, ensuring it correctly handles input image paths and outputs results in a structured format (likely JSON to stdout for consumption by the TypeScript service).
4.  **Update TypeScript OCR Service (`ocrTilingService.ts`):** Integrate the Python pipeline by spawning it as a child process, passing the image data (via a temporary file facilitated by the volume mount), and parsing the JSON output. This will involve removing the old TypeScript OCR implementation.

This revised context highlights the successful Docker setup for development and points towards completing the core Python logic before fully integrating with the Encore.js backend.
