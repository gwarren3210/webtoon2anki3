# Context for Next Chat (Chat 19)

This document outlines the remaining tasks and relevant context for the next chat session regarding the webtoon-to-Anki project backend.

## Current State

-   The basic functional structure of `backend/services/main.ts` is in place.
-   Jest testing is partially set up in the `backend` directory with `ts-jest` and initial test files.
-   A unit test with mocks and an integration test calling actual services have been added to `backend/services/main.test.ts`.
-   Error handling for OCR timeouts in the test environment has been added.
-   Several test setup and configuration issues (TS errors, Jest config, Vitest imports) have been addressed.
-   A lingering type error in the `main.test.ts` unit test related to mock typing remains unresolved.
-   The integration test revealed an issue where the `ocr-space-api-wrapper` likely requires a string file path as input, not a Buffer.
-   The integration test also requires the sample image file (`sample-webtoon-image.png` in `backend/services/test-data/`) and the `OCR_API_KEY` environment variable to be set to run fully.

## Remaining Tasks / Next Steps

1.  **Address OCR API Input Type:** Modify `backend/services/ocr-api/smartOcrProcessor.ts` (specifically the `processImage` and `processDirectly` methods) to ensure that the input provided to the `ocr-space-api-wrapper` is always a string (either the original path if the input was a string, or the path to a temporary file if the input was a Buffer).
2.  **Resolve `main.test.ts` Mock Typing Error:** Investigate further or find a workaround for the persistent type error (`Argument of type 'TranslatedWordInfo[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.`) in the `processWebtoonImage - Unit` test suite.
3.  **Implement Actual Validation Tests:** Add meaningful test cases to `backend/services/validation/fileValidationService.test.ts`.
4.  **Complete `main.ts` Implementation:** Flesh out the logic within `processWebtoonImage` to correctly call the text grouper, translation engine (`translateDeck`), and Anki package handler with the appropriate data transformations between each step.
5.  **Refine Error Handling:** Review and refine the error handling throughout the `main.ts` pipeline and potentially in the individual service functions.
6.  **Add More Comprehensive Tests:** Write additional unit and integration test cases for `main.ts` to cover different scenarios (e.g., different languages, error conditions at various stages).
7.  **Address Encore `TS2307` Error:** Investigate and resolve the `TS2307` error in the `encore.gen` directory, which indicates an issue with Encore's code generation or service resolution for the OCR endpoint. This might require changes outside of the `services` directory or consulting Encore documentation.

## Relevant Files

-   `backend/services/main.ts`
-   `backend/services/main.test.ts`
-   `backend/services/ocr-api/index.ts`
-   `backend/services/ocr-api/smartOcrProcessor.ts`
-   `backend/services/types.ts`
-   `backend/jest.config.cjs`
-   `backend/tsconfig.json`
-   `backend/services/test-data/sample-webtoon-image.png` (requires manual addition)
-   Environment variable `OCR_API_KEY` (requires manual setting)

This context should help us pick up where we left off and continue working on the backend implementation and testing in the next session.
