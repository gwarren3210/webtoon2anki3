## Learnings & Updates: Translation Service Summary

This document summarizes the setup, initial decisions, implementation, and testing of the translation service and the Papago translation engine in the backend of the `webtoon2anki3` project.

### Translation Service Setup

**Context:**

The goal is to implement a feature to translate text extracted from images, specifically focusing on individual words while retaining their original line context.

**Key Decisions and Steps:**

1.  **Project Structure:** Decided to implement the translation logic in the `backend/services` directory, creating a new `translation` service.
2.  **Data Structure (`TranslatedWordInfo`):** Defined a new TypeScript type to hold the translation information. The proposed structure includes:
    *   `originalWord`: string
    *   `originalWordBbox`: BoundingBox (initially included)
    *   `originalLine`: string
    *   `originalLineBbox`: BoundingBox (initially included)
    *   `translatedWord`: string
    *   `translatedLine?`: string (optional)
3.  **Bounding Box Discussion:** Evaluated the necessity of `originalWordBbox` and `originalLineBbox`. The pros are enabling visual linking/interaction with the original image (highlighting, click-to-translate). The cons are the potential need for significant refactoring of the existing OCR/text processing pipeline to obtain word-level bounding boxes. The final decision on whether to keep bounding boxes was left to the user based on priority of visual features vs. refactoring effort.
4.  **Abstraction for Translation Methods:** Planned to use an interface (`ITranslationEngine`) to abstract different translation services, allowing easy switching between implementations (e.g., Papago, Google Translate, etc.).

**Files Created/Modified:**

*   `backend/services/types.ts`: Added the `TranslatedWordInfo` type definition.
*   `backend/services/translation/translationEngine.ts`: Created and defined the `ITranslationEngine` interface.
*   `backend/services/translation/translationService.ts`: Created as the main service file (implementation outline discussed).

### Papago Engine Implementation

**Context:**

Following the decision to use an abstract `ITranslationEngine`, the first concrete implementation using the `papago-translate` NPM package was developed.

**Key Decisions and Steps:**

1.  **File Structure:** Created `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.ts` to house the Papago-specific implementation.
2.  **Implementation:** Developed the `PapagoTranslateEngine` class implementing `ITranslationEngine`, including a constructor to initialize the `papago-translate` client and methods (`translateWord`, `translateLine`) to call the Papago API.
3.  **Handling JS Package without Types:** Addressed the TypeScript linter error for the `papago-translate` JavaScript package by creating a declaration file (`backend/services/translation/papago-translate.d.ts`) with `declare module 'papago-translate';`.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Initially planned unit tests using Jest mocks, but switched to integration tests upon user request.
    *   Created `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.test.ts`.
    *   Implemented tests that instantiate `PapagoTranslateEngine` and call its methods with real Korean input to verify translation output against expected English translations using `.toContain()` for flexibility.
    *   Resolved Jest global type errors in the test file by installing `@types/jest` and ensuring `beforeAll` was imported from `@jest/globals`.

**Files Created/Modified:**

*   `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.ts`: Implemented the Papago translation logic.
*   `backend/services/translation/papago-translate.d.ts`: Created for TypeScript declarations for the Papago package.
*   `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.test.ts`: Created and modified for integration tests.

**Terminal Commands Executed:**

*   `npm install papago-translate`: Installed the translation package.
*   `npm install --save-dev @types/jest`: Installed Jest type definitions.

**Next Steps:**

*   Run the integration tests to confirm the Papago engine works as expected.
*   Proceed with implementing the main `backend/services/translation/translationService.ts` logic, utilizing the `ITranslationEngine` interface.
*   Consider adding more robust error handling and potentially retry mechanisms in `PapagoTranslateEngine`.
