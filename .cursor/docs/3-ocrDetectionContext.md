# OCR Detection Context (for Next Chat)

## Current State
- **Backend:** TypeScript (Encore.ts), PaddleOCR logic stubbed, region detection (rectangles/ellipses) working via opencv4nodejs.
- **Tested on:** `sample-images/row-1-column-1.jpg` (expects 7 ellipses detected).
- **Tests:** Colocated, use direct service import, with logging for debugging.

## Key Decisions
- PaddleOCR chosen for accuracy and language support.
- TypeScript-only backend (no Python).
- opencv4nodejs for shape detection.
- Template matching/contour analysis for region detection.

## Next Steps
- Implement actual OCR for detected regions (currently returns placeholder text).
- Refine detection logic as needed.
- Expand tests to cover rectangles and more complex images.

## Open Questions/TODOs
- What OCR engine/library to use for text extraction in TypeScript?
- How to handle edge cases (overlapping bubbles, partial shapes)?
- Performance/scalability for large batches?
