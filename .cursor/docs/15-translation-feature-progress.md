## Conversation Summary: Translation Feature Progress

This document summarizes the key aspects of the conversation regarding the implementation of a translation feature for the `webtoon2anki3` project.

**Initial Goal:** Implement a translation feature focusing on translating individual words, retaining line context, and considering the translation of the full line.

**Project Exploration:**

*   Examined the project structure (`backend`, `frontend`, `services`) to identify the best location for the translation logic.
*   Identified relevant backend directories (`ocr-api`, `text-grouper`) that likely handle text processing.
*   Reviewed `backend/services/types.ts` to understand existing data structures like `BoundingBox`, `OcrResult`, and `OcrLineResult`.

**Data Structure Design (`TranslatedWordInfo`):**

*   Proposed and defined the `TranslatedWordInfo` type to store original word, original line context (text and bounding box), translated word, and optional translated line.
*   Discussed the pros and cons of including bounding boxes (`originalWordBbox`, `originalLineBbox`), noting the potential need for refactoring in upstream OCR/text processing if visual linking features are desired.

**Translation Service Architecture:**

*   Decided to create a new `translation` service within `backend/services` for separation of concerns.
*   Planned an abstract design using an `ITranslationEngine` interface (`backend/services/translation/translationEngine.ts`) to allow switching between different translation service providers.
*   Outlined the main `TranslationService` (`backend/services/translation/translationService.ts`) which will orchestrate the translation process using an `ITranslationEngine` instance.

**Papago Translation Engine Implementation:**

*   Implemented `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.ts` as a concrete implementation of `ITranslationEngine` using the `papago-translate` NPM package.
*   Handled the lack of TypeScript types for the `papago-translate` package by creating a declaration file (`backend/services/translation/papago-translate.d.ts`).
*   Implemented integration tests in `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.test.ts` to verify the Papago engine's functionality by calling the actual API with sample Korean text.
*   Resolved Jest global type errors in the test file by installing `@types/jest` and importing necessary globals.

**Files Created/Modified:**

*   `backend/services/types.ts` (Added `TranslatedWordInfo`)
*   `backend/services/translation/translationEngine.ts` (Created and defined `ITranslationEngine`)
*   `backend/services/translation/translationService.ts` (Created, outline discussed)
*   `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.ts` (Implemented Papago engine)
*   `backend/services/translation/papago-translate.d.ts` (Created declaration file)
*   `backend/services/translation/papagoTranslateEngine.test.ts` (Created and modified for integration tests)
*   `.cursor/docs/14-translation-service-summary.md` (Created combined summary)
*   `.cursor/docs/14-translation-service-setup.md` (Deleted)
*   `.cursor/docs/15-papago-engine-implementation.md` (Deleted)

**Terminal Commands Executed:**

*   `npm install papago-translate`
*   `npm install --save-dev @types/jest`

**Next Steps Identified:**

*   Run the Papago engine integration tests.
*   Implement the main logic in `backend/services/translation/translationService.ts`.
*   Finalize the decision on including bounding boxes based on desired features.
*   Consider more robust error handling in the translation engine.
