# Current Conversation Context for Webtoon to Anki API Backend

This document provides a summary of the current state of our development efforts on the `webtoon2anki3` backend, focusing on the `ocr-api` service and related testing.

## Key Areas of Recent Focus:

1.  **`backend/services/ocr-api/smartOcrProcessor.ts` Updates:**
    *   **Simplified `filterOcrResults`**: The logic for filtering OCR results has been streamlined. It now uses a map to deduplicate results based on the rounded center X and Y coordinates of bounding boxes. When duplicates occur at the same position, the entry furthest from the tile's Y-edges (top/bottom) is prioritized. Any complex text merging or advanced overlap detection logic was removed, as it is expected to be handled by other parts of the pipeline.
    *   **`createAdaptiveTiles` Logic Adjustment**: The calculation for `finalTileHeight` within this method was modified by the user to `imgHeight / baseDivisions`. This change directly influences how images are segmented into tiles.
    *   **Debugging Logs**: Extensive `console.log` statements have been added to `createAdaptiveTiles` to aid in diagnosing tiling behavior, specifically to understand why a large image was producing an unexpected number of tiles.

2.  **Testing Infrastructure (`backend/services/ocr-api/test/ocrApi.test.ts`):**
    *   **Test Refinements**: Outdated test cases related to previous `filterOcrResults` logic were removed. The `createAdaptiveTiles` test was updated to use a `large-sample.jpg` (1.8MB) and now asserts for exactly two tiles with correct overlap, and also verifies that each generated tile's size is below the configured `fileSizeThreshold`.
    *   **New Isolated Test Suite**: A new `describe.only` block, `SmartOCRProcessor Large Image OCR Test`, was introduced to specifically test the end-to-end OCR processing for the `large-sample.jpg` and save its results to `../test-data/largeImageOcrOutput.json`.
    *   **Asynchronous File Handling**: The `fs` imports were consistently updated to `import { promises as fs } from 'fs';` and `await` was added to `fs.readFile` calls to ensure proper promise-based asynchronous file operations.

3.  **Main Test Execution (`backend/services/testMain.ts`):**
    *   **Modular Test Functions**: The main test execution script was refactored into `runSmallImageTest` and `runLargeImageTest` to handle different image sizes and output distinct Anki packages.
    *   **Asynchronous `fs` for Main Test**: All file system operations in `testMain.ts` were migrated to their promise-based asynchronous equivalents (`fs.stat`, `fs.mkdir`, `fs.writeFile`) using `await`.
    *   **Sequential Execution**: Both `runSmallImageTest` and `runLargeImageTest` are now executed sequentially.

4.  **Running TypeScript Files:**
    *   Due to the `"type": "module"` setting in `backend/package.json`, TypeScript files must be run using `ts-node` with the `--esm` flag. For example: `npx ts-node --esm backend/services/testMain.ts`.

## Next Steps (Implicit):

*   Review the output from the newly added logging to understand the tiling behavior further.
*   Validate the OCR results for the large image in `largeImageOcrOutput.json`.
*   Continue with the integration of text grouping, translation, and Anki package creation, ensuring these subsequent steps correctly handle the output from the updated OCR service.
