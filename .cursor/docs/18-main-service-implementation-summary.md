# Main Service Implementation Summary (Chat 18)

This document summarizes the progress and key learnings from implementing and testing the main backend service (`backend/services/main.ts`) for the webtoon-to-Anki project.

## Implementation Plan

A simple, functional plan was created for `backend/services/main.ts`, focusing on orchestrating calls to other services (OCR, Text Grouper, Translation, Anki) without using classes. The main function `processWebtoonImage` was outlined to take image data and an OCR API key, process the data through the pipeline, and return an Anki package (`ArrayBuffer`).

## Testing Setup and Challenges

A Jest test file (`backend/services/main.test.ts`) was created to test the `processWebtoonImage` function. This led to several challenges related to setting up Jest for a TypeScript project with ES modules and different test types:

1.  **`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`**: Initial attempts to run `.ts` files directly with `ts-node` or `npx ts-node` failed due to how Node.js handles ES modules and file extensions. This required ensuring `ts-node` and TypeScript were correctly installed and using `npx ts-node` from the project root, or configuring Jest with `ts-jest`.
2.  **TypeScript Compilation Errors (`TS1259`)**: Errors like `Module '...' can only be default-imported using the 'esModuleInterop' flag` occurred due to conflicts between CommonJS (`export =`) and ES Module (`import`) syntaxes used by some libraries (`path`, `sharp`) and the project's configuration. This was resolved by adding `"esModuleInterop": true` to `backend/tsconfig.json`.
3.  **Jest Configuration for TypeScript/ESM**: Jest needed explicit configuration to process `.ts` files as ES modules using `ts-jest`. This involved modifying `backend/jest.config.cjs` to set `preset: 'ts-jest'`, `testEnvironment: 'node'`, configure the `transform` property, and add `extensionsToTreatAsEsm: ['.ts', '.tsx']`.
4.  **Vitest Imports in Jest Environment**: Some test files (`main.test.ts`, `tempStorageService.test.ts`) were using `vitest` imports (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`) in a Jest-configured project. This caused errors. The fix was to change these imports to use Jest's globals (`@jest/globals`) and replace `vi` with `jest` for mocking.
5.  **Jest Mock Typing (`Argument of type 'TranslatedWordInfo[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'`)**: A persistent type error in `main.test.ts` related to the typing of a Jest mock (`handleAnkiPackageCreation`) proved difficult to fully resolve with standard type casting approaches within the test file. This was noted as a lingering issue.
6.  **Integration Test Setup**: A separate `describe` block was created in `main.test.ts` for an integration test that calls the actual `processWebtoonImage` function without mocks.
7.  **OCR API Timeout and Fallback**: The integration test revealed timeouts when calling the external OCR API. Logic was added to `processImageForOCR` to catch the specific timeout error (`E101: Timed out waiting for results`) and return sample `OcrResult` data *only* when running in a test environment (`process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test'`).
8.  **OCR API `input` Type Error**: The OCR integration test also hit an error (`Param input is required and must be typeof string`) indicating the `ocr-space-api-wrapper` expected a string file path or similar, but likely received a Buffer. This was identified as needing a fix in `SmartOCRProcessor.processImage` to ensure a string path is always passed to the wrapper.
9.  **Missing Sample Image/API Key**: The integration test would skip if the sample image file was not found or the `OCR_API_KEY` environment variable was not set.

## Key Takeaways

*   Setting up a TypeScript project with Jest and ES modules requires careful configuration of `tsconfig.json` and Jest config files (`jest.config.cjs`).
*   Mixing testing frameworks (Vitest and Jest) in the same project or even the same test file can lead to import and compatibility issues. Stick to one framework or ensure clear separation and correct imports.
*   Mocking in Jest, especially with TypeScript, can sometimes lead to complex typing challenges. Explicitly typing mocks can help but isn't always straightforward.
*   Integration tests help uncover issues between different parts of the application and external dependencies that unit tests (with mocks) might miss (e.g., the OCR API input type issue, timeouts).
*   Conditional logic based on `NODE_ENV` is useful for differentiating test-specific behavior (like API fallback) from production behavior.
