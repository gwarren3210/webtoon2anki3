# OCR Service Comparison: PaddleOCR vs EasyOCR

## Context & Requirements
- This document compares **PaddleOCR** and **EasyOCR** for integration into the Webtoon2Anki project.
- Requirements: high accuracy (â‰¥95%), Korean language support, batch processing, fast performance, robust error handling, and ease of integration with the existing image upload foundation ([see summary](./0-image-upload-foundation-summary.md)).

---

## 1. PaddleOCR

### Overview
- Open-source OCR toolkit by Baidu, built on the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework.
- Supports 80+ languages, including strong support for Asian scripts (Korean, Chinese, Japanese).
- Modular pipeline: text detection, recognition, layout analysis, table recognition, and more.
- Offers lightweight (PP-OCR) and high-accuracy (PP-OCRv4) models.

### Pros
- **High accuracy**: State-of-the-art on many benchmarks, especially for Asian languages and complex layouts.
- **Multilingual**: Excellent support for Korean and other CJK scripts.
- **Layout & Table Analysis**: Advanced document structure recognition (PP-Structure).
- **Batch & Edge Deployment**: Optimized for batch processing, mobile, and edge devices (ultra-light models).
- **Extensible**: Custom model training, fine-tuning, and pipeline customization.
- **Active development**: Frequent updates, large community, and industrial adoption.
- **Open-source (Apache 2.0)**: Free for commercial use.

### Cons
- **Complexity**: More involved setup and configuration than EasyOCR; documentation is partly in Chinese.
- **Resource requirements**: High-accuracy models may require more memory/compute (GPU recommended for best speed).
- **Python-centric**: Best supported in Python; other language bindings less mature.

## 2. EasyOCR

### Overview
- Open-source Python OCR library by JaidedAI, built on PyTorch.
- Supports 80+ languages, including Korean.
- Simple API: one-liner text extraction from images.
- Uses deep learning (CRNN, LSTM, CTC) for recognition.

### Pros
- **Ease of use**: Extremely simple API, quick setup, minimal configuration.
- **Multilingual**: Good support for Korean and other major scripts.
- **Batch processing**: Supports batch image OCR with simple loops.
- **Lightweight**: Runs on CPU or GPU; suitable for most modern hardware.
- **Open-source (Apache 2.0)**: Free for commercial use.
- **Active community**: Well-documented, many examples.

### Cons
- **Accuracy**: Slightly lower than PaddleOCR on complex layouts and Asian scripts (per recent benchmarks).
- **Limited layout analysis**: No built-in table or advanced document structure recognition.
- **Extensibility**: Custom model training is possible but less modular than PaddleOCR.
- **Performance**: Slower than PaddleOCR for large batches unless using GPU.

## 3. Head-to-Head Summary Table

| Feature                | PaddleOCR                | EasyOCR                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Accuracy**           | High (esp. Asian/CJK)    | Good, slightly lower     |
| **Korean Support**     | Excellent                | Good                     |
| **Layout/Table**       | Advanced (PP-Structure)  | Basic (text boxes only)  |
| **Batch Processing**   | Optimized, fast          | Supported, less optimized|
| **Edge/Mobile**        | Ultra-light models       | CPU/GPU, no edge focus   |
| **Ease of Use**        | Moderate (more config)   | Very easy (1-liner API)  |
| **Extensibility**      | High (custom pipelines)  | Moderate                 |
| **Community/Updates**  | Large, active            | Active, smaller          |
| **License**            | Apache 2.0               | Apache 2.0               |

## 4. Suitability for Webtoon2Anki
- **PaddleOCR** is recommended for highest accuracy, especially for Korean comics with complex layouts, speech bubbles, and batch processing needs. Its advanced layout analysis and modularity align well with future requirements (e.g., table/structure extraction, edge deployment).
- **EasyOCR** is a strong choice for rapid prototyping, simple integration, and projects where ease of use is paramount. It is suitable for basic comic OCR but may require more post-processing for complex layouts.

## 5. Lessons from Image Upload Foundation
- Both tools can be integrated with the existing backend services for image validation and storage.
- Error handling and batch processing should be robustly tested, as per foundation phase lessons.
- PaddleOCR's modularity may better support future requirements for document structure extraction and error recovery.
