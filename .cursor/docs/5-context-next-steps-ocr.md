# Context for Next Steps (Python OCR)

This document outlines the current state of the Python OCR implementation and the planned next steps based on the task list in `.cursor/OCR-TASKS.md`.

## Current Status

1.  **File Structure:** The Python scripts for OCR processing are located in the `backend/python/ocr` directory.
2.  **Environment:** A stable Python environment with `opencv-python` and `paddleocr` installed has been successfully set up and verified using Docker with a `python:3.8-slim` base image and necessary system dependencies.
3.  **Image Tiling:** The `image_tiling.py` script has been refactored to use OpenCV and has been successfully tested within the Docker container, demonstrating its ability to split an image into overlapping tiles.

## Next Steps

Based on the task list in `.cursor/OCR-TASKS.md`, the immediate next steps are to implement the remaining Python scripts:

1.  **Implement `run_ocr_on_tile.py`:** Write the Python code to perform OCR on a single image tile using the installed `paddleocr` library. This script should take an image tile as input and output the detected text and bounding boxes.
2.  **Implement `deduplicate_ocr_results.py`:** Write the Python code to process the OCR results from multiple overlapping tiles and deduplicate overlapping or redundant text entries to produce a final, clean list of text and their locations.

## Integration with Encore (Future Steps)

After the core Python OCR logic (tiling, OCR on tiles, deduplication) is implemented and tested, the subsequent steps will involve integrating this Python functionality with the TypeScript backend in Encore. The planned integration approach involves using a child process to execute the Python scripts from the TypeScript service.

Further steps will include creating an Encore API endpoint, updating the TypeScript service to call the Python scripts, implementing error handling, writing tests for the integration, and updating the task lists.
