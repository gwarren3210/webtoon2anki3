### Technical Constraints
- **Environment:** Browser-based JavaScript/TypeScript implementation
- **Storage:** Local storage (IndexedDB) for study progress and vocabulary
- **Performance:** Must work on mobile devices with smooth 60fps animations
- **Offline Capability:** Should function without internet connection
