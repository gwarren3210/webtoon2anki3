# Image Upload Foundation: Implementation & Lessons Learned

## Context
This document summarizes the implementation and process for the Image Upload Foundation phase of the Webtoon2Anki project. It covers the backend and frontend setup for image upload, validation, temporary storage, and error handling, as well as key lessons and rules reinforced during development.

## Implementation Overview
- **Frontend file upload component**: Drag-and-drop UI, file type validation, preview, and user feedback.
- **Backend file validation service**: Validates image type and size, returns clear error messages, colocated tests.
- **Temporary file storage service**: Saves, reads, and deletes files in a `tmp/` directory, with robust error handling and colocated tests.
- **Error handling**: All backend services now return or throw clear, actionable errors. Tests cover error scenarios.

## Key Lessons & Rules Reinforced
- **Strict project structure**: All backend services must reside in `backend/services` and its subdirectories. Never use a top-level `services` directory.
- **Colocated testing**: All logic must have colocated tests, which must be run and pass before a task is considered complete.
- **Documentation**: Each service and major function must be documented, including error handling and testing coverage.
- **Post-task requirements**: After completing a task, update documentation, mark the task as complete in `.cursor/TASKS.md`, and ensure all rules are followed.
- **Error handling**: All services must handle and report errors clearly, and tests must cover error scenarios.

## Next Steps
- Connect the frontend file upload component to the backend validation and storage services.
- Begin OCR service research and integration.
