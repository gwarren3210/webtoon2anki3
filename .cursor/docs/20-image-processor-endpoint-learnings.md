# Image Processor Endpoint - Code Updates and Learnings

This document summarizes the code changes and key learnings from the conversation regarding the implementation of an Encore API endpoint to process images and return `.apkg` files.

## Code Updates

- Created a new Encore service `image-processor` in `backend/services/image-processor/`.
- Defined a raw POST endpoint `/process-image` in `backend/services/image-processor/imageProcessor.ts` to handle image file uploads.
- Implemented file upload handling within the raw endpoint using the `busboy` library.
- Added logic to save the incoming image buffer to a temporary file using Node.js `fs/promises`, `path`, `os`, and `crypto` modules.
- Modified the endpoint to read `sourceLang` and `targetLang` as query parameters from the request URL.
- Configured the endpoint to use the `OCR_API_KEY` environment variable for the OCR process.
- Imported and called the existing `processWebtoonImage` function from `backend/services/main.ts`, passing the temporary file path and obtained parameters.
- Handled the response to return the generated `.apkg` file content as a downloadable file with appropriate headers (`Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition`).
- Included cleanup logic to delete the temporary image file after processing.
- Added test public endpoints `/hello` (GET) and `/test-post` (POST) in `imageProcessor.ts` for verification.
- Updated the temporary file extension assumption from `.png` to `.jpg`.

## Learnings

- Encore raw endpoints (`api.raw`) are suitable for handling custom request/response formats like file uploads and downloads.
- File uploads in Node.js Encore endpoints can be handled using libraries like `busboy`.
- Temporary files can be created using `os.tmpdir()` and handled with `fs/promises`.
- `process.env` is the standard way to access environment variables (like API keys) in Encore.
- Passing parameters via query string is achievable by parsing `req.url`.
- Resolving strict TypeScript type errors (e.g., `Buffer[]` vs `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>[]`) sometimes requires explicit type assertions (`as unknown as Uint8Array[]`).
- For standard Encore API endpoints defined with `api(...)`, both the `@encore api public` annotation (for compiler/deployment) and the `expose: true` property in the configuration object (for local dashboard visibility) are necessary for them to appear in the Development Dashboard.
- The standard structure for an Encore service involves an `encore.service.ts` file in a directory and endpoint functions defined in *other* `.ts` files within that directory.
- Stopping a background `encore run` process on Windows requires using `tasklist` to find the PID and `taskkill` to terminate it, as `encore stop` was not available in the observed version.
- Trailing commas in JSON configuration files like `tsconfig.json` can cause parsing errors.
