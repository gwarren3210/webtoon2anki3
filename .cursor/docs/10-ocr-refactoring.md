## Current State of OCR Refactoring

The refactoring of the OCR implementation to use the `ocr-space-api-wrapper` is in progress. The core logic has been implemented in the `SmartOCRProcessor` class, which resides in `backend/services/ocr-api/smartOcrProcessor.ts`. Utility functions are in `ocrApiUtils.ts`, and `index.ts` provides convenience functions. The necessary types are defined in `types.ts`. An integration test (`ocrApi.test.ts`) has been created and successfully runs, saving a sample API response to `ocrOutputSample.json`.

Remaining manual cleanup includes deleting the Python subdirectories in `backend/python/ocr`.

## Remaining Tasks

Based on `.cursor/OCR-TASKS.md`, the following tasks remain:

-   **Refine OCR Implementation** [Complexity: 6/10] [P0]
    -   Refine text merging and coordinate adjustment for overlapping tiles. [6/10] [P0]
    -   Enhance error handling for API calls and file operations. [4/10] [P0]

-   **Update Main TASKS.md** [Complexity: 2/10] [P0]
    -   Reflect changes in OCR approach.

-   **Write Tests** [Complexity: 6/10] [P0]
    -   Write unit tests for the `SmartOCRProcessor` and utility functions. [6/10] [P0]

## Detailed Commit Message

```
feat: Refactor OCR implementation using ocr-space-api-wrapper

This commit refactors the existing OCR implementation to utilize the `ocr-space-api-wrapper` npm package, replacing the previous Python and manual TypeScript approach.

Key changes include:

- Removed outdated Python OCR code directory (`backend/python/ocr`) and associated TypeScript files (`backend/services/ocr-tiling/runOcrOnTile.test.ts`, `runOcrOnTile.ts`, `deduplicateOcrResults.ts`). Note: Python subdirectories still require manual removal.
- Installed the `ocr-space-api-wrapper` npm package.
- Updated `.cursor/OCR-TASKS.md` to reflect the refactoring progress and new file structure after the manual directory rename from `ocr-tiling` to `ocr-api`.
- Implemented the core OCR processing logic in a new `SmartOCRProcessor` class within `backend/services/ocr-api/smartOcrProcessor.ts`.
- Split the main OCR service file into smaller, more modular files: `smartOcrProcessor.ts`, `ocrApiUtils.ts`, and `index.ts`.
- Updated the `OcrResult` type definition in `backend/services/ocr-api/types.ts` to include a `confidence` property.
- Addressed and fixed linter and runtime errors related to `ocr-space-api-wrapper` parameter usage, Node.js built-in module imports (`os`, `path`), and file path resolution in tests.
- Created an integration test (`backend/services/ocr-api/test/ocrApi.test.ts`) to verify the basic functionality of the new OCR service.
- Modified the integration test to save the OCR results to `ocrOutputSample.json` for use in creating mock data for future unit tests.

Remaining work includes refining the text merging and error handling logic within the `SmartOCRProcessor`, updating the main project `TASKS.md`, and writing comprehensive unit tests.
