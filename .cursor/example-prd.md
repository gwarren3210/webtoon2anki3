# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Cursor

*Example PRD template from a startup PM with prior Google experience*

---

## 1. Document Overview

- **Product Name:** Cursor  
- **Authors:** Jane Doe, Product Manager (formerly Lead PM @ Google)  
- **Date:** May 28, 2025  
- **Version:** 1.0  
- **Stakeholders:** Engineering, Design, Data Science, Marketing, Sales, Customer Success  

---

## 2. Executive Summary

**Cursor** is an intelligent code-completion and navigation assistant designed to boost developer productivity within IDEs and code editors. By leveraging advanced AI-driven context understanding, Cursor will not only suggest code completions but also surface relevant documentation, perform instant code search across repositories, and enable “smart cursor” movements (jump-to-definition, find usages, highlight dependencies).

---

## 3. Problem Statement

- **Context Switching:** Developers waste significant time switching between editor, documentation, and search tools.  
- **Incomplete AI Assistants:** Existing code-completion tools often generate syntactically correct suggestions but lack project-specific context and fail to integrate with documentation or cross-repo search.  
- **Onboarding Friction:** New team members struggle to understand codebases quickly due to scattered knowledge and lack of in-editor guidance.  

**Customer Pain Points**  
- “I have to leave my editor constantly to look up docs.”  
- “The AI suggestions don’t know my project’s coding conventions.”  
- “Finding where functions are used across 10+ microservices is painful.”

- **So that** I don’t need to switch to my browser  

### 6.3 Cross-Repository Search  
- **As** a New Team Member  
- **I want** to search for function definitions and usages across all my organization’s repos  
- **So that** I can quickly understand dependencies  

### 6.4 Project Tour Mode  
- **As** a New Team Member  
- **I want** an automated guide that highlights core modules, data models, and entry points  
- **So that** I onboard faster  

### 6.5 Metrics & Analytics Dashboard  
- **As** a Tech Lead  
- **I want** to see team-wide usage stats, suggestion acceptance rates, and common search queries  
- **So that** I can identify training needs and optimize coverage

## 9. User Flows & Wireframes

1. **Code Completion Flow**  
   - User types “`fetch(`” → Cursor suggests function signature + import statement.  
2. **Documentation Lookup Flow**  
   - User hovers over function → Inline panel slides out showing docs.  
3. **Search Flow**  
   - User invokes “Ctrl+Shift+F” → Search dialog; types query; results grouped by repo/file.

## 14. Open Questions

1. What is the budget and timeline for SOC 2 Type II audit?  
2. Are there preferred data residency requirements (e.g., EU-only)?  
3. Should we support additional IDEs (e.g., Eclipse) in Phase 2?
