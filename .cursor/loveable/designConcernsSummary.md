# Webtoon Cards: Design Critique Synthesis & Priorities

## Key Design Concerns to Address Next

### 1. Content Acquisition & Scalability
- **Copyright & Licensing:** Secure partnerships with webtoon publishers to avoid copyright issues and ensure a steady stream of content.
- **Content Updates:** Develop a strategy for regular, scalable content updates to keep users engaged and prevent content fatigue.

### 2. Long-Term Engagement & Retention
- **Habit Loops:** Implement features like streaks, daily goals, reminders, and achievement systems to encourage daily use.
- **Motivation Beyond Novelty:** Add extrinsic motivators (XP, badges, social features) to supplement intrinsic motivation from webtoon fandom.

### 3. Onboarding & Beginner Experience
- **Guided Onboarding:** Create a clear, friendly onboarding flow (guided tour, starter packs, or skill assessment) to help new users get started.
- **Explain SM-2:** Clearly introduce the spaced repetition system to avoid confusion for new users.

### 4. Mobile & Accessibility
- **Mobile-First Design:** Prioritize mobile usability (one-handed use, swipe gestures, thumb-friendly navigation).
- **Accessibility:** Conduct an accessibility audit (fonts, color contrast, audio, dyslexia-friendly options).

### 5. Social & Community Features
- **Community Engagement:** Add forums, study groups, deck sharing, and gamified uploads to foster community and accountability.

### 6. Progress Visualization & Feedback
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Show users their growth (heatmaps, badges, mastery stats), not just what needs review.
- **Feedback Loops:** Implement robust feedback mechanisms for user suggestions and progress tracking.

### 7. UX & Flow
- **Cognitive Load:** Use progressive disclosure and clear guidance to avoid overwhelming users with options.
- **UI Friction:** Address potential issues with fixed footers and visual overload, especially on mobile.

### 8. Audio & Pronunciation Support
- **Audio Integration:** Add audio pronunciation and TTS for vocabulary cards.

### 9. Monetization & Business Model
- **Sustainable Revenue:** Define a monetization strategy that does not harm the user experience.
