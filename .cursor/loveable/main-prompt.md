#### üìç Step 1: Start with the App Summary

 I'm creating a Korean language-learning app for desktop and mobile web that uses vocabulary from Korean webtoons. It's called **Webtoon Cards**.

 The app helps beginner to intermediate learners study vocabulary pulled from Korean webtoons using SM-2 spaced repetition flashcards. The visual identity should balance fun and utility‚Äîappealing to webtoon fans while remaining focused enough for serious study. Think cozy but not cartoonish.

 I want the **light mode** to be playful and colorful (with webtoon-style accents), and the **dark mode** to be sleek and minimal.
