> Design a frontend for a Korean language-learning web app called **"Webtoon Cards"** (feel free to use a placeholder name if you have better ideas). The app helps beginner to intermediate learners study vocabulary pulled from Korean webtoons using SM-2 spaced repetition flashcards. It’s a responsive desktop-first web app with a playful, colorful **light mode**, and a sleek, minimal **dark mode** for night learners.
>
> The visual identity should balance fun and utility — appealing to webtoon fans while remaining focused enough for serious study. Think cozy but not cartoonish.
>
> **Pages to Design:**
>
> ### 1. Home Page
>
> * A welcoming landing page that introduces the app.
> * Options to “Continue as Guest” or log in/register.
> * Clear, friendly overview of how the app works (flashcards + webtoons + uploads).
> * Strong visuals, upbeat language, illustrations or webtoon-style accents.
>
> ### 2. Explore Page
>
> * Browse public decks built from popular webtoons.
> * Organize by: Difficulty (Beginner/Intermediate), Genre (Romance, Action, etc.), and Popularity.
> * Include a search bar that supports both Korean and English titles.
> * Show cover art for each webtoon or series deck.
>
> ### 3. Study Page
>
> * Minimalist interface for reviewing flashcards using SM-2 logic.
> * One card at a time. Flip to reveal, then choose difficulty (again: easy, hard, etc.).
> * No distractions. Maybe a progress bar or “words left today.”
> * Different card styles based on light/dark mode aesthetic.
>
> ### 4. User Library
>
> * Shows series/decks the user is studying.
> * Highlights what needs review (use badges, progress bars, or subtle urgency).
> * Option to “Review All” or filter by series.
> * May resemble Explore but tailored to the user’s learning journey.
>
> ### 5. User Profile
>
> * Basic profile with avatar, username, learning stats (e.g. streak, cards learned, most studied series).
> * Option to manage uploads (if any), and profile settings.
>
> ### 6. Upload Flow (optional page or modal)
>
> * Allow users to upload their own webtoon/comic chapters.
> * Choose to keep private or contribute to the public library.
>
> **Other Notes:**
>
> * Guests can browse and study in “basic mode.”
> * Use static data only — no real authentication or backend needed.
> * Prioritize intuitive navigation and seamless flow between pages.
> * Include visual examples or placeholders for Korean text and vocab cards.
