# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

0. Include rule index in [index.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/index.mdc)

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

````
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:
```typescript
// Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```
````

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples


  - Use consistent formatting across rule1
